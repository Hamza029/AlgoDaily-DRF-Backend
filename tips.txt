things to remember after starting an app:
- add/update relevant settings
- add urls.py
- include the app urls in project urls
- register the app in admin.py
- add models
- make migrations
- add serializers
- create views

migration
- "python manage.py makemigrations" will create migration files based on the changes in models
- "python manage.py migrate" will run the migration from migration files
